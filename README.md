# course-catalog-project
Final project for my high school databases course. Utilizes Java (JDBC) to manage a locally hosted database of courses.

I was still a beginner programmer at the time, and as such, this code is not the cleanest or most efficient. However, it is fully functional for the purposes of a final project.
